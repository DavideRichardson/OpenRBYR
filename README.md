# OpenRBYR: A Ray-by-Ray CT Simulation Toolkit

## 📌 Overview
OpenRBYR is an open-source Python package for simulating Ray-by-Ray Computed Tomography (RBYRCT) scan paths. This toolkit enables researchers to explore and develop CT imaging methodologies with a focus on precision and low-dose imaging techniques.

### Features:
- **Simulated ray paths & scan trajectories**: Model different CT setups and beam configurations.
- **Monte Carlo simulation integration**: Example setups for **TOPAS** and **Geant4**.
- **Basic MART-like reconstruction**: Implementations to test reconstruction methods.
- **Synthetic CT phantoms**: Sample datasets for algorithm validation.

## 🛠 Installation
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/HussainAther/OpenRBYR.git
cd OpenRBYR

# Create a virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 🚀 Getting Started
Here’s an example of how to simulate a simple CT scan setup:
```python
from openrbyr import ray_simulation

# Simulate rays for a CT setup
rays = ray_simulation.simulate_rays(num_rays=100, detector_distance=50)
ray_simulation.visualize_rays(rays)
```
